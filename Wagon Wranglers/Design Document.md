**Game Design Document**



**Concept**

The concept is that the player controls a cart that can move around on a flat plane. There are falling objects that the player must run around to collect and store inside the cart. The key experience we're going for is the player must balance being quick with being careful.



**Setting**

The game will be set on a flat plane, the look is currently undetermined.



**Game Structure**

The game will begin with the player in the middle of the plane. Then, the timer starts, and the player must quickly run around catching items. More items fall faster as the timer nears zero. After reaching zero the end state will initiate, showing the player how much points they earned based on how many items they ended with.



**Objective statement**

Is it a challenging but fair experience to balance being careful about not losing items with being fast to catch more items?



**Players**

The game would be single player only, but if we were to add multiplayer, it would be in the form of one player driving the cart and one player rotating items to fit inside the cart.
